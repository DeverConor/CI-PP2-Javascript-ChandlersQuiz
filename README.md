# Chandlers Thanksgiving Game

### Concept
A little while back my wife put on Friends. It’s a comforting show, you don't have to pay too much attention to it, it’s comforting and not too challenging. That is of course until it is. Friends is well remembered for it’s holiday episodes. Monica with a turkey on her head, and Ross dressed as the ‘Holiday Armadillo’ come to mind. However it was a different Thanksgiving episode that caught my attention. Not the one where Joey eats and entire turkey or the one where they play football. It was the one where Chandler challenges the group of New Yorkers to name all 50 states in six minutes. 

When someone said “oh you can't just make a quiz or a game, it’s too easy.” I thought, but what about a quiz-game? So here it is, the concept is frightfully simple, build a quiz game where contestants have to name all fifty US states in 6 minutes. The execution however, well…

## Features
### Timer
At the very top of the page we have our timer. The concept is that this clock is to look like a lot like the countdown timer in a basketball game. It begins counting down when the first answer is entered into the entry field.
  
### Image
The image which greets users is a screengrab from the episode in which Chandler in one line explains the parameters of the game. This I think would be a nice bit of nostalgia for players as well as mixing up the media on the page so it is not all text. 

### Answer box
Beneath the image we have the answer input, when users enter their first answer the clock begins and if the answer is correct the score box updates and the state is entered into the state list at the bottom of the page. 

### Scorebox
To keep a tally on how many correct answers the user has entered we have a scorebox which is added to every time the user answers a correct answer. 


### State list
Once the user starts answering correct answers it will become important that they know which answers they have answered correctly already. This is where the state list comes in. Once the user has entered a correct answer the state list keeps a track of all of the correct answers the user has entered already.
